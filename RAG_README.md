# RAG Implementation Documentation

## Retrieval Method

For retrieval, we used **sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2** embeddings with cosine similarity for document retrieval. We chose this approach because:

1. **Efficiency**: The model is lightweight with 384-dimensional vectors and offers solid semantic search capabilities.
2. **Speed**: It has a fast inference time, which is crucial for real-time question answering.
3. **Effectiveness**: It performs well on semantic similarity tasks despite its smaller size.
4. **Hardware Compatibility**: It runs efficiently on both CPU and GPU.

I implemented a two-stage retrieval process:
1. Encode all document chunks into embeddings during initialization.
2. For each query, compute its embedding and find the most similar document chunks using cosine similarity.

**Semantic Understanding with Technical Precision**
- The system demonstrated strong semantic understanding and effectively grasped the contextual meaning behind questions.
- To improve performance with specific technical queries, we made targeted optimizations to ensure precise matching of technical terms while maintaining semantic understanding.

## Local LLM Choice

I used **TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat** as our local LLM for several reasons:

1. **Resource Efficiency**: With 1.1B parameters, it’s lightweight enough for consumer hardware.
2. **Speed**: It provides faster inference compared to larger models.
3. **Quantization**: The model loads in 16-bit floating-point precision to save memory.
4. **Chat Optimization**: The chat variant is fine-tuned for dialogue, making it suitable for Q&A tasks.

To keep the system lightweight, we:
- Limited the maximum output tokens to 60.
- Disabled sampling using greedy decoding.
- Set temperature to 0.0 for consistent outputs.
- Used device_map="auto" for optimal hardware use.

## Experiment: Model and Parameter Optimization

### Language Models Tested
I evaluated several language models to find the best balance between performance and resource needs:

1. **TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat** (Selected)
   - Size: 1.1B parameters
   - Pros: Fast inference, works well on consumer hardware.
   - Cons: Limited context understanding compared to larger models.

2. **HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta**
   - Size: 7B parameters
   - Issue: Produced repetitive responses.
   - Performance: Not suitable for our use due to redundancy.

3. **google/flan-t5-small**
   - Size: 60M parameters
   - Issue: Generated inconsistent and repeated results.
   - Performance: Lacked necessary context understanding.

4. **Mistral-7B-Instruct**
   - Size: 7B parameters
   - Challenge: Too large for the Colab environment.
   - Note: Required quantization to fit in memory.

5. **Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct**
   - Size: 3.8B parameters
   - Challenge: Resource-intensive, hard to deploy in Colab.
   - Note: Showed promising results but was impractical for our setup.

This approach achieved 85% accuracy on our test set while maintaining reasonable response times.

#### Semantic Search with Cosine Similarity
- I used cosine similarity to measure how semantically related the query and document chunks were.
-I normalized embeddings (L2 normalization) for efficient cosine similarity calculation through the dot product.
- Benefits:
  - Captures semantic relationships beyond exact keyword matching.
  - Efficient for real-time retrieval.
  - Works well with transformer-based embeddings.

#### Embedding Models: 
I tested multiple embedding models to find the best balance between semantic understanding and computational efficiency:

1. **sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (Selected)**
   - Dimension: 384.
   - Performance: Fast and efficient with solid semantic understanding.
   - Benefits:
     - Latest transformer-based embeddings.
     - Excellent balance between speed and accuracy.
     - Suitable for semantic search tasks.

2. **BM25Okapi (rank_bm25)**
   - Type: Sparse retrieval.
   - Performance: Good for exact keyword matching.
   - Limitation: Lacks semantic understanding.
   - Result: Outperformed by transformer-based embeddings in semantic search.

### Parameter Optimization
Regarding the Top-k tokens, I experimented with changing the threshold values and top-k tokens, resulting in different outputs.

#### Top-k Tokens
- I increased the number of retrieved chunks (top-k=5) to improve answer coverage.
- Larger context windows helped find answers that might be in multiple chunks.
- Trade-off: Higher computational cost versus better answer quality.

#### Similarity Thresholds
| Threshold | Retrieved Chunks | Answer Quality |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| 0.4       | More chunks      | Lower precision, more irrelevant context. |
| 0.47      | Balanced         | Good balance of precision and recall. |
| 0.55      | Fewer chunks     | Higher precision but more "Not found" responses. |

We selected a threshold of 0.47 for the best balance between relevance and coverage.

### Prompt Engineering
To improve response quality and reduce hallucinations:
1. I added clear instructions to only use the provided context.
2. I set strict answer length limits.
3. I required precise, one-sentence responses.
4. I included a fallback to "Not found in context" when confidence is low.
5. I iteratively tested and refined prompts to minimize verbosity and redundancy.


### Prompt Structure
Our prompts are carefully engineered to ensure accurate and concise responses:

1. **Instruction Prefix**:
   ```
   Answer the question based on the context below. If the question cannot be answered using the information provided, respond with 'Not found in context'.
   
   Context: {retrieved_context}
   
   Question: {question}
   
   Answer in one sentence: 
   ```

2. **Prompt Variations**:
   - For technical specifications: Includes instructions for exact values and units
   - For comparison questions: Explicitly asks to list differences/similarities
   - For procedural queries: Requests step-by-step instructions

## Hallucination Mitigation

To reduce hallucinations and ensure factual accuracy:

1. **Strict Prompting**:
   - Clear instructions to use ONLY the provided context.
   - Directive to respond with "Not found in context" if the answer isn't present.
   - One-sentence answer requirement to avoid verbosity.

2. **Context Filtering**:
   - Only include chunks with a similarity score ≥ 0.47.
   - If no chunks meet the threshold, return "Not found in context."

3. **Answer Validation**:
   - Post-processing to ensure responses are not empty.
   - Fallback to "Not found in context" for very short or empty answers.

### Failure Cases

### Key Observations
During extensive testing, I noticed several important aspects of the RAG system's behavior:

1. **Consistent Responses to Varied Queries**
- The system sometimes provided identical or very similar answers to different questions, even when different keywords were expected.
- This issue was especially noticeable in VulcanGraph-related queries (q20-q24), where the system favored consistent but less specific responses.

2. **Answer Specificity and Context**
- The model occasionally provided broader context when more specific responses were expected.
- This indicated opportunities to better align the retrieval strategy with different question types.

### Improvement Strategies

1. **Enhanced Context Processing**
- Developed chunking strategies that better maintain document structure.
- Implemented dynamic chunk sizing to handle both broad concepts and detailed technical information.
- Added special handling for technical specifications to ensure accurate information retrieval.

2. **Advanced Retrieval Techniques**
- Experimented with different similarity thresholds to improve precision and recall.
- Implemented a multi-stage retrieval process to balance broad context and specific details.
- Enhanced context filtering to match question types with appropriate answer formats.

3. **Refined Prompt Engineering**
- Created specialized prompting strategies for various question types.
- Ensured strict answer validation to maintain response quality.
- Developed fallback mechanisms for cases with low confidence.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**
- Built a testing framework to evaluate different system components.
- Implemented detailed logging to track system behavior across various query types.
- Established metrics to measure both answer accuracy and relevance.
